# TV Show Details

 The React JS application allows users to browse through a list of TV shows using the TVMaze API. When the user first opens the application, they are presented with the first screen that displays a list of TV shows. This screen shows the name of each TV show and some additional details, such as the network that produces the show, the genre, and the rating.

When the user clicks on a particular TV show from the list, they are taken to the second screen that shows the summary of that show. This screen provides more detailed information about the show, such as its plot summary, cast and crew, and other details. Additionally, this screen has a button that allows the user to book a movie ticket for that show.

When the user clicks the "Book Now" button, a form is opened with the movie name and some relevant details pre-filled. The user can then fill out the form with their personal information and complete the booking process.

Overall, the application provides a simple and user-friendly way for users to browse through TV shows and book tickets for their favorite shows.
